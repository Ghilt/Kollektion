// TODO

/*
*  1. create list by having function which takes an int in and that int decides how big list is and then input numbers
*  2. inner functions need explicit creation ,its too messy right now
*  3. parenthesis to give precedence
*  4. fix precedence
*  5. Maybe move nop operator to lexing stage, cant lead with one atm as it messes up context creator of FC
